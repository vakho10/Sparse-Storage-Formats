#Sparse Storage Formats

This repository consists of 2 separate projects: the main project    (***Sparse Project***) and the secondary project (***NNZ vs    Dense***). The purpose of these two projects is to show the    effectiveness and advantage of the **jnz-format** when using (square    and positively-defined) dense matrices.
